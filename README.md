SDK for interacting with the Phoenix program.

We currently have a Rust and Typescript SDK, with Python on the way.

To run the sample Rust code, run:

```
$ cd rust
$ cargo run --bin sample -- -r $YOUR_DEVNET_RPC_ENDPOINT
```

To run the sample typescript code, run:

```
$ cd typescript/phoenix-sdk
$ yarn
$ ts-node tests/test.ts
```
